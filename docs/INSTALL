             INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------

Before running pBot, you MUST run the configuration utility to check that you have all the required modules.
To do this use:

./configure

If all required CPAN modules are working and exist, you are ready to start using pBot.
Before you do, you will need to edit the following files:

* bot.conf

Once you have edited all the required files, you are then ready to run pBot!
To do this use the recommended command:

'nohup perl run.pl > bot.log &'
